Input Format

You are not responsible for reading any input from stdin. The Solution class creates a Book object and calls the MyBook class constructor (passing it the necessary arguments). It then calls the display method on the Book object.

Output Format

The void Display() method should print and label the respectivetitle author  ,price , and  of the MyBook object's instance (with each value on its own line) like so:
Solution-

class MyBook extends Book{
    int price;
    MyBook(String title,String author,int price){
        super(title,author);
        this.price=price;
        
    }
    void display()
    {
        System.out.println("Title: "+title);
         System.out.println("Author: "+author);
         System.out.println("Price: "+price);

    }
}
