Input Format

Input from stdin is handled for you by the locked stub code in your editor. 
The first line contains an integer,T , the number of test cases. 
Each of the T  subsequent lines describes a test case in 2 space-separated integers denoting n and p, respectively.

Constraints

No Test Case will result in overflow for correctly written code.
Output Format

Output to stdout is handled for you by the locked stub code in your editor.
There are T lines of output, where each line contains the result of n^p as calculated by your Calculator class' power method.
